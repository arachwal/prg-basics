Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 30. If the number is divisible by 3 then the program prints the word 'THREE'.
Next, if the number is divisible by 5 then the program prints the word 'FIVE'. 
Finally, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then the program prints the word 'BINGO'. Sample result:

1 2 THREE 4 FIVE THREE 7 ...
